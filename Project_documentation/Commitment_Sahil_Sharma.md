## Commitment
Definition : The state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity. With respect to our project I am going to focus on the commitment. And I will be updating the commitment value which our team has incorporated during entire project lifecuycle.

### Definition
A commitment-driven sprint planning meeting involves the product owner, ScrumMaster and all development team members. The product owner brings the top-priority product backlog items into the meeting and describes them to the team, usually starting with an overview of the set of high-priority items.

We have focused on following values under commitment: 
- A team succeeds/fails together, there is no **I** in the team.  
- Each member responsibel for their part and account for it. if not met, as a team pitch in and try to giure ot out.  
- Knowledge sharing and commiting to a common goal.  

## Week 1

Below are the core agile value of Commitment seen in Week 1 development:  

* From the first week as we discussed over e-mails, theri commitments and weekly hours they can commit for it, seems like everyone has this spirit and clear expectation and their role within the team.  
* Few peoples were good at few things and other's have their own skills (like UI expertise, Back end concepts, Deployment), but everyone team were curious and other's were helpful to share and teach the concepts which other's were kind of back. Hence it shows a positive commitment to deliver the product.
