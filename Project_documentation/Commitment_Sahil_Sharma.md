## Commitment
Definition : The state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity. With respect to our project I am going to focus on the commitment. And I will be updating the commitment value which our team has incorporated during entire project lifecuycle.

### Definition
A commitment-driven sprint planning meeting involves the product owner, ScrumMaster and all development team members. The product owner brings the top-priority product backlog items into the meeting and describes them to the team, usually starting with an overview of the set of high-priority items.

We have focused on following values under commitment: 
- A team succeeds/fails together, there is no **I** in the team.  
- Each member responsibel for their part and account for it. if not met, as a team pitch in and try to giure ot out.  
- Knowledge sharing and commiting to a common goal.  

## Week 1

Below are the core agile value of Commitment seen in Week 1 development:  

* From the first week as we discussed over e-mails, theri commitments and weekly hours they can commit for it, seems like everyone has this spirit and clear expectation and their role within the team.  
* Few peoples were good at few things and other's have their own skills (like UI expertise, Back end concepts, Deployment), but everyone team were curious and other's were helpful to share and teach the concepts which other's were kind of back. Hence it shows a positive commitment to deliver the product.

## Week 2

Below are the core agile value of Commitment seen in Week 2 development:  

* Since we had two projects Individual and the Hackathon, we had two flavors of Databases in our application Redis and Riak, Team spent entire week in researching about their Databse selected, and later during the weekly meeting I could see everyoen pooled in and figured out the impediments encountered collaboratively. This clearly shows a sense of commitment in the team for a common goal.  

* There was a problem , when one of our team member fell sick and was unable to participate in person in meeting, he still atended the weekly meeting through Hangout. Thsi clearly shows a level of commitment within the team.  

## Week 3

Below are the core agile value of Commitment seen in Week 3 development:  

* In week 3 of Development, we also got a chance to attend the AWS summit at San Fransisco, Two members from our team attended that session and shared the knowledge between us. We also got some free credits for the AWS account, whcih helped for Hackathon project. We researched and asked few of AWS members and also learntabout different cloud hosting technologies, Redis Hence we used few of the functionalities in the project. This clearly demonstrates the Commitment with in the team and deication towards the work. 
* After the session everyone in teh team kicked off for developing their API and committed to finish their Ping API by end of next week.
