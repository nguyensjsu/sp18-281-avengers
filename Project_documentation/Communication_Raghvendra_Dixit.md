Since our requirements and matches to the Applicability mentioned above we found this value to be extremely important and worth mentioning

# Weekly Progress :  

## Week 1
* The first thing first, we were new to each other, the only known thing and common thing between us is the CMPE281- Cloud class. We were kind of pen-friends.  
* Once the team was decided during first week, we initiated the conversation by sharing e-mails, highlighting our background, hobbies, commitment for project and work experience (if any).  
* The email shairing activity brought everyone on the same page and we had our expectations set with each other. We also proposed our availablty time for meetings in the e-mail. 

## Week 2
* As per the e-mails exchanges and the availblity time of individuals, we found the best time for team meeting is to meet at the Library post our Cloud class and discuss the weekly tasks before hand.  
* Team seemed to be involved and enthusiatic , everyone suggested their ideas and creative thinking for the project ideas and models, we sensed everyone in the team has a willing and can-do attitude, which is a good sign.  
* We also discussed how were progressing on our Individual project, and discussed our approach, to avoid any communication gaps later and any unexpected appals at later point of time.  
* we created a google drive to share our common documents and files.  
* Creted Slack channel for better communication and connectivity.  

## Week 3
* Since everyone was almost clear in deciding their database and approach for their individual project, we came up with few ideas for our hackathon project like : Starbucks API, Counter Burger, Piza Delivery, Food Delivery.  
* We decided to proceed with Counter Burger, as it has almost good number of CRUD functionality, which everyone in team can pick up and also create for their individual project.  
* After a long discussion, everyone on the same page and we had a very highlevel overview of the functionality to be implemented in our application. 
* In full one week during research and since our team we have two varieties of Databases Riak and Redis there were many problems as if how we are gonna establish connection.  
* We also decided on the High Level overview and architecture of the Counter Burger Application.  
* Since in after working and Re-searching on the topic for the entire week, we also decided which individual is gonna take which functionality. we decided and communicated within the team.
