This Document tells about the value **Communication** and how our team incorporated this vlaue as a part of our application development phase cycle.

### Communication meaning in Extreme Programming(XP)

# Definition
* Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team. XP is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development. 

# Applicability

* Dynamically changing software requirements
* Risks caused by fixed time projects using new technology
* Small, co-located extended development team

Since our requirements and matches to the Applicability mentioned above we found this value to be extremely important and worth mentioning

# Weekly Progress :  

## Week 1
* The first thing first, we were new to each other, the only known thing and common thing between us is the CMPE281- Cloud class. We were kind of pen-friends.  
* Once the team was decided during first week, we initiated the conversation by sharing e-mails, highlighting our background, hobbies, commitment for project and work experience (if any).  
* The email shairing activity brought everyone on the same page and we had our expectations set with each other. We also proposed our availablty time for meetings in the e-mail. 

## Week 2
* As per the e-mails exchanges and the availblity time of individuals, we found the best time for team meeting is to meet at the Library post our Cloud class and discuss the weekly tasks before hand.  
* Team seemed to be involved and enthusiatic , everyone suggested their ideas and creative thinking for the project ideas and models, we sensed everyone in the team has a willing and can-do attitude, which is a good sign.  
* We also discussed how were progressing on our Individual project, and discussed our approach, to avoid any communication gaps later and any unexpected appals at later point of time.  
* we created a google drive to share our common documents and files.  
* Creted Slack channel for better communication and connectivity.  

## Week 3
* Since everyone was almost clear in deciding their database and approach for their individual project, we came up with few ideas for our hackathon project like : Starbucks API, Counter Burger, Piza Delivery, Food Delivery.  
* We decided to proceed with Counter Burger, as it has almost good number of CRUD functionality, which everyone in team can pick up and also create for their individual project.  
* After a long discussion, everyone on the same page and we had a very highlevel overview of the functionality to be implemented in our application. 
* In full one week during research and since our team we have two varieties of Databases Riak and Redis there were many problems as if how we are gonna establish connection.  
* We also decided on the High Level overview and architecture of the Counter Burger Application.  
* Since in after working and Re-searching on the topic for the entire week, we also decided which individual is gonna take which functionality. we decided and communicated within the team.  

## Week 4
* In this week during discussion we created Architecture diagram. So that eveyone is crystal clear about what is going in the application and how we are gonna achieve.  
* Since it was decided that Go to be used as a backend, eveyone as per their assigned functionality started working on their APIs basic functionality and discussed the problems encountered in the weekley meetings and on Whatsapp group very often.  
* Almost everyone was done with theri Ping functionality both for Redis and Riak team.  

## Week 5
* In this week Communication played an important role, everyone needs to be in synch as there were some changes and common attributes/variables whichh needs to be shared among the Go APIs, we discussed on that veryoften.  
* There were some chnages in the Design patterns as well which also needs to be communicated and conveyed within team , that was well established and taken care.  
* Difference in two Database was one problem , but since due to continous exchnages of thoughts and knowledge shairing within the team helped us to cross that barrier as well.  
* In this week team was almost done with their CRUD(GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE) APIs well functionaing.  

## Week 6
* Thsi week was our last week which was very crucial, as we have to create the UI and Integrate every microservice we built.  
* Since we were good in planning and due to strong communication within team things progressed smoothly, we created the UI in Nodejs and also implemented flavor of Bloc-chain in our app.
* Since there was lot of integration and the attributes passing from one microservice to another was actually in picture, which requires a lot of co-ordination, that why we thought uninamously to decide on some common library working hours and we sat and worked in close knit group, Libraryas a place and whiteboard as our brainstorming board served our purpose for group meetings, which helped in delivering what we intended.
