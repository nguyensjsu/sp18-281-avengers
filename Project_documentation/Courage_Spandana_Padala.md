# Courage 
Courage is the ability overcome the fear,pain,uncertainity during the process of development.This is one of the most important feature in the Agile Manifesto.Courage is needed during the following scenarios:
* Handle pressure to release the product when it is not yet ready
* Pressure to take up the changes during the very late stages of development
* Help team to solve the issues and escalate when required
* Have face-face communication with the team to discuss on various aspects 
* Support team in replanning when required
* champion agile process, by switching different roles of being a mentor,seek advice from team at any point of time

All the above are very common in every stage of development, hence Courage is considered to one of the most important aspect of Agile Environment

# Courage shown Week 1 :
* On 24th March 2018, I have initiated to have discussion with the team after professor Paul has assigned the Hackathon project.We had discussion to explore on various applications that we can build aligning to the project requirement.
*  We decided to meet again on 28th March to come up with various ideas to build an application
*  On 28th March we discussed on various ideas proposed by each team members, discussed on functionalities of each team members ideas and with courage openly rejected few ideas of cloning the facebook app and cloning of Amazon app, as we felt that we should focus more on the ways of deployment and the architecture rather spending more time on the complex functionalities involved

# Courage shown in Week 2:
* I have initiated to have discussion to work on Counter Burger application and various features to be implemented. However it was rejected by few team members as they have their own ideas, but I couragely explained them why I have my idea to implement the Counter Burger application stating that we should concentrate more on architecture aspects and deployment rather building a very complex front end application.
* Finally everyone realised the key aspect of the project requirement and decided to work on Counter Burger application
