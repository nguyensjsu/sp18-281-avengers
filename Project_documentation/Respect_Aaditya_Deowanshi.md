# Respect  
  
## Respect in Agile 
A simple core value, yet very powerful and important, A high-performing team is built on mutual respect. Every team member has his weaknesses and strengths, respecting those will help the team to work together. The golden rule of any team is to respect each other’s suggestions. Admitting when you are either stuck or wrong is hard. Respect makes these actions possible.

## Respect shown in Week 1
The core agile value of respect is shown in the following instances during week 1:
  
* On hearing about the project from the professor, the developers in the team insisted on using AWS ECS or docker cloud for the team project. The members in the team - though few don't have prior experience in AWS ECS respected this decision. This is a clear representation of the team showing respect towards other team-mate's interests.
    
* While working on the wiki pages and Readme.md, the team mates recognized that they have very limited exposure on go api's and web development. This is a clear indication of respect present in the team as they openly admitted it when they are stuck, which is impossible if the team mates dont respect each other.
