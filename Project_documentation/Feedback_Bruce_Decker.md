# Agile Core Value Feedback

This documentation is for reflecting our challenges and progress throughout our code development and code integration. It is very important for a team for gather feedbacks and formulate new solutions. In this development process, we kept this feedback journal to document our teamwork and engineering development process. In an agile team, it is highly collaborative. Hence, individual team memeber need to adopt  changes. The team's success depends on self-organized and highly collaborative individuals. In addition, the team needs continuous feedback. Feeback is defined as past constructive advice on the present. Interpersonal communication is also indispensable in this agile development. Agile will not work without constructive feedback.

Feedback loops are crucial in agile development. They also serve as important mechanisms for validating changes and getting feedbacks. Daily coding practices, automation and tools are included in feedback loops. There are hundreds of loops in giving feedbacks during agile development. Team members will share tips and challenges 

### Code Reviews 
Code reviews will help with constructive feedback for agile development. 
1. Dedicated to conducting code reviews at least 


## Week 1
On week one, we discussed architecture and topic related to our team project. 
* In the early stage of development, we discussed how to integrate Go API with front end code
* Choose which database to use
* Discussed Redis and Riak database
*  Received feedback from teammates
*  Starting making architecture diagram

On week one, we discussed the types of databases we were going to use like Redis or Riak.  We also talked about basic architecture

## Week 2
On week 2, we discussed the frequency of individual feedback as well as group feedback. All feedbacks are documented to help with future development process. 
* Talked about using docker cloud and dockerizing our code
* Started drawing front end UI design on Sketch. Discussed challenges we encountered. 
* Discussed Redis and Riak database
*  Received feedback from teammates
*  Faced some issues in configuring Redis master slave configuration


## Week 3
On week three, we discussed past feedbacks. Each team member started working on their own assigned tasks. 
*  Team members also shared their findings and research
*  Started showing results and discussed among team members
*  Resolved problems and code reviews
*  Team members talked about their progress
* Started on Go API 
* Team members expressed their concerns and problems
* The whole talked about continuous improvements 

## Week 4
On week 4, the team continued working on coding and documentation.
* Had issues with connecting Riak and Redis on Go API
*  Tried to resolve the issue
*  Looked at ways to deploy our application
*  Improved UI
*  Tried to find out the best way to improve UI
*  Worked on organizing code

## Week 5
On week 5, we finalized our code and entire project.
*  Worked on front end integration with back end
*  Started testing our application
*  Deployed front end on Heroku
*  Team members reported problems with NodeJs and Go API
* Solved the problem with Ajax
*  Continuously improved code

## Week 6
On week 6, we did more testing to ensure our app was working correctly.
*  Manually tested the app
*  Deployed Go API on Docker cloud
*  Encouraged team members to have constructive feedbacks
