# Cmpe281 Hackathon Project Feedback

# Agile Core Value Feedback

This documentation is for reflecting our challenges and progress throughout our code development and code integration. It is very important for a team for gather feedbacks and formulate new solutions. In this development process, we kept this feedback journal to document our teamwork and engineering development process. In an agile team, it is highly collaborative. Hence, individual team memeber need to adopt  changes. The team's success depends on self-organized and highly collaborative individuals. In addition, the team needs continuous feedback. Feeback is defined as past constructive advice on the present. Interpersonal communication is also indispensable in this agile development. Agile will not work without constructive feedback.

Feedback loops are crucial in agile development. They also serve as important mechanisms for validating changes and getting feedbacks. Daily coding practices, automation and tools are included in feedback loops. There are hundreds of loops in giving feedbacks during agile development. Team members will share tips and challenges 

### Code Reviews 
Code reviews will help with constructive feedback for agile development. 
1. Dedicated to conducting code reviews at least 


## Week 1
On week one, we discussed architecture and topic related to our team project. 
* In the early stage of development, we discussed how to integrate Go API with front end code
* Choose which database to use
* Discussed Redis and Riak database
*  Received feedback from teammates

On week one, we discussed the types of databases we were going to use like Redis or Riak.  We also talked about basic architecture

## Week 2
On week 2, we discussed the frequency of individual feedback as well as group feedback. All feedbacks are documented to help with future development process. 
* Talked about using docker cloud and dockerizing our code
* Started drawing front end UI design on Sketch. Discussed challenges we encountered. 
* Discussed Redis and Riak database
*  Received feedback from teammates
