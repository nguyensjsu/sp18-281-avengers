# Cmpe281 Hackathon Project Feedback
# Agile Core Value Feedback
This documentation is for reflecting our challenges and progress throughout our code development and code integration. It is very important for a team for gather feedbacks and formulate new solutions. In this development process, we kept this feedback journal to document our teamwork and engineering development process. In an agile team, it is highly collaborative. Hence, individual team memeber need to adopt  changes. The team's success depends on self-organized and highly collaborative individuals. In addition, the team needs continuous feedback. Feeback is defined as past constructive advice on the present. Interpersonal communication is also indispensable in this agile development. Agile will not work without constructive feedback.

Feedback loops are crucial in agile development. There are hundreds of loops in giving feedbacks during agile development.
